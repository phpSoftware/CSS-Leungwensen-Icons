CSS Leungwensen Icons
=====================

> v1.0.0 (2020-04-11)

__Download [Leungwensen Icons](https://leungwensen.github.io/svg-icon/) 
and run `icon.php` on e.g. localhost. 
It will read SVG icons from the folder `leungwensen` and it\'s subfolder and build css from it.
Now you can use the `leungwensen-SUBFOLDER.css` without the SVG Icons!__

**HINT:** SubFolder `flag`, `game` and `logos` don\'t work!
